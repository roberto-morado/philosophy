# Iroh's Philosophy

Welcome to the public roadmap for Iroh's Philosophy!

I am excited to share the plans and progress with the community as I work to bring General Iroh's wisdom to the world in the form of a quote API.

My goal is to make it easy for anyone to access and benefit from the words of this beloved character from the show Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Here, you will find information on the current and upcoming features, as well as the development timeline.

I am committed to constantly improving and expanding my offerings, and your feedback is essential to making that happen.

I encourage you to share your thoughts and suggestions on the roadmap, and I look forward to building this project together with you.
